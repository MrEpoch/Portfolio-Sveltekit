badly responsive on small devices. Responsive design is one of the main themes of current web building which
is a must to have on a website. Most users always come from phones or similarly
smaller devices which makes it harder to scale to their sizes for me as a developer.`,S,_,j,g,L=`Styling was done through Tailwindcss which is for me most important technology for this project. When

Performance is one of the main points why I use SvelteKit, but one thing I
do that brings the whole performance down is loading images, I usually add loading
animation when an image is not totally loaded to prevent it from suddenly jumping in.`,M,b,U=`I used typescript, but I use it mainly for type-checking fatal errors, many times I find it pretty
